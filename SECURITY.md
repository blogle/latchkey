# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
- Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately to maintainers before public disclosure.
- Include impact, affected components, and reproduction steps when possible.

## Response expectations
- Initial triage target: within 5 business days.
- Confirmed issues receive a remediation plan and target release window.

## Scope notes
- Do not include live credentials, customer data, or private keys in reports.
- Security fixes should preserve least-privilege and deny-by-default defaults.
